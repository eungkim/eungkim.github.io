### About
I am a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at [Music and Audio Research Group, Seoul National University](https://snu-marg.notion.site). My research interests lie in robust and efficient speech processing. In particular, I am working on domain shift and uncertainty (robustness); knowledge distillation (architectural efficiency); semi-supervised learning and training acceleration (data efficiency).
